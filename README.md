### User Stories

The API and Frontend of this project was planned using Agile methodology and MoSCoW prioritization on github projects.

The user stories project can be found [here](https://github.com/Hujanen91/sourdoughcircle_frontend/milestones)

The project was illustrated by 13 initial Milestone entitled<br>
<b>"Profiles",<br>
"Posts",<br>
"Likes",<br>
"Comments",<br>
"Category",<br>
"Followers",<br>
"Admin",<br>
"Contact",<br>
"Community Chat",<br>
"Authentication",<br>
"Routing",<br>
"Notifications"</b> and<br>
<b>"Navigation"</b><br> providing the developer with the freedom to accomplish all issues/tasks flexibly before dates deadline set to June. The Milestones were broken according to their components name main functions.

Throughout the development process, new milestones were added, where tasks started from "Todo," progressing to "In Progress," and finally "Done". The issues were assigned to the sole developer and labeled as "could-have," "should-have,", "must-have", "wont-have" and later on labels like "has been implemented" and "future implementation" was also added.

![Project overview](docs/images/Userstories_planning.png)

### Design Choices

- <b>Simple Navigation with Social Proof:</b> The navigation bar uses clear and concise labeling, with icons, to help users find the features they're looking for. It also incorporates a "Most Followed Profiles" section, highlighting users and potentially acting as social proof to new visitors.<br>
- <b>Content Previews and User Activity:</b> The bottom portion of the page showcases a section with "Search posts" and "Filter by Category" options, encouraging users to explore content. Below this section are previews of user posts, including images and captions. This gives visitors a quick glimpse into the kind of content they can expect to find on the platform.<br>
- <b>Muted Color Palette:</b> The color scheme uses a muted color palette of whites, greys, and a light olive green. This unobtrusive color scheme puts the focus on the content and avoids overwhelming users.

#### Colors

- <b>Primary Background:</b> The primary background color is a very light beige or off-white (#f8f8f8). This neutral color creates a clean and airy feel for the website.<br>
- <b>Navigation Bar:</b> The navigation bar uses a dark gray (#363636) for the icons and font. This dark color creates a clear contrast with the light background and makes the text icons easily readable.
The light background for the navbar is a light green/olive color (#bed1bae7) with some opacity to it for some effect while scrolling.
- <b>Text Colors:</b> A bluish black (#212529) is used for the fonts on the website.
- <b>Logo, highlights and hover:</b> The main logo on the page contains colors like (#ad4a31) and (#ff9254) and they have both been used on smaller details like buttons, icons and the hover colors to keep adding some pop of color<br>

Overall, the color palette leans towards cool neutrals with a touch of muted green, creating a sense of calmness and professionalism that aligns with the minimalist design of the website.

![Color palette](docs/images/sourdoughcircle-colors.png)

#### Typography

The font used is Barlow, a friendly and approachable sans-serif font, to make everything on the platform clear, easy to read, and inviting.<br>

Here's why Barlow is perfect for SourdoughCircle:<br>

- <b>Clear and Crisp:</b> Barlow's clean lines and open letterforms ensure all the sourdough goodness – from your post captions to comments – is easy to see, no matter what device you're using.<br>
- <b>Warm and Welcoming:</b> The slightly rounded edges of the Barlow typeface give it a touch of friendliness, reflecting the warm and inviting atmosphere of the SourdoughCircle community.<br>
- <b>Modern and Versatile:</b> Barlow's modern style keeps SourdoughCircle feeling fresh and up-to-date, while its versatility allows it to adapt to all kinds of content.

#### Imagery

SourdoughCircle keeps it simple and to the point with its app iconography.

- <b>Sourdough Icon:</b> The app utilizes a single, clean line drawing of a loaf of sourdough bread as both the favicon and the main icon in the navbar. This minimalist design makes the icon easily recognizable and ensures it scales well across different devices and screen sizes.<br>
- <b>Focus on Sourdough:</b> By featuring the bread itself, the icon immediately communicates the app’s purpose – a platform dedicated to sourdough bread.

- The rest of the icons and imagery follows along matching the colors and styles of the main navbar logo with clean lines, playful colors and easy for the eyes.

### Known Bugs

**Current Status**:<br> 
As of the latest deployment, no major bugs are deployed to the website. There's been a few during production that has been either temporarily solved or left as it is:<br>

- During production somehow the /Feed and /Likes searchfield and category filtering stopped working. 
Different AI:s was asked about the issue without any of them finding a solution that would work.
Console.logs and console.errors was used to try to pinpoint the issue but the API was fetching everything as it was supposed to.
My mentor looked at it for a moment and couldn't really see where the problem was due to the filtering and searchfield being defined in the same components as the <br>

      Solution:
      Due to the timelimit of this project this bug had to be either left as it was or hidden. I went with the last option and decided to hide the Searchbar and Category filtering on the /Feed and /Liked pages.
      This solution felt like the better one so that the page did not contain non functional features for the users.
      The Homepage still has these futures and they are working perfectly on that page and is fetching the right data.

- The like and comment count on /Feed and /Liked page also stopped working probably at the same time as the previus bug above. The icons are displayed just as they should and the like button is clickable and is acting as it should. 
The comment count on the other hand is not working as it should and is not displaying. 
If a user likes the post and then unlike it the word "NaN" is appearing next to the like icon. The "NaN" will then be gone if the user updates the page and the icon will still be marked as "liked".<br>

      Solution: 
      This has been left as it is due to the timelimit but also due to it not being such an extreme bug and it functions as it should apart from not displaying the numbers.

**Devtools**

Websocket warning:
A websocket warning is happening in the console in devtools. After searching in Slack for this issue I found out it is a known bug and something with some packages in the background non reachable to the user.
Different solutions was tested withouth any success.

## Deployment

### Heroku

This project is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform service that enables easy deployment and scaling for web applications. The deployment process includes the following steps:

#### Initial Setup

1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up for a Heroku account at [Heroku's website](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. **Install Heroku CLI**: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with Heroku from your local machine.

#### Preparing the Application

1. **Procfile**: Create a `Procfile` in your project root directory. This file tells Heroku how to run your application.
2. **Requirements.txt**: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies.
3. **Config Vars**: Set up necessary configuration variables in Heroku (like `SECRET_KEY`, database URL, etc.).

#### Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku App**: Use the Heroku CLI to create a new app.
2. **Add Buildpacks**: If necessary, add the correct buildpacks via the Heroku dashboard or CLI.
3. **Deploy**: Push your code to Heroku either by connecting your GitHub repository to Heroku or using the Heroku CLI to deploy your application.
4. **Database Migration (if applicable)**: Run database migrations using the Heroku CLI.

#### Final Steps

1. **Enable the Web Dyno**: Make sure the web dyno is up and running after deployment.
2. **Open the App**: You can open your application from the Heroku dashboard or using the CLI command `heroku open`.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub repository allows you to make a copy of the original project on your own GitHub account, enabling you to make changes without affecting the original. Here's how to do it:

1. **Go to the Repository**: Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button, located at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
3. **Clone Your Fork**: Once forked, you can clone your fork to your local machine for further development.

### Making a Local Clone

Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy on your machine, allowing you to sync between the two locations. Here are the steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: On the GitHub repository page, click the 'Code' button and copy the URL under 'Clone with HTTPS'.
2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the clone to be created.
