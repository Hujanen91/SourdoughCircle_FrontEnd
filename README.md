By keeping these things in mind, SourdoughCircle is building a one-of-a-kind platform for sourdough lovers to connect, create, and be inspired.

### User Stories

The API and Frontend of this project was planned using Agile methodology and MoSCoW prioritization on github projects.

The user stories project can be found [here](https://github.com/Hujanen91/sourdoughcircle_frontend/milestones)

The project was illustrated by 13 initial Milestone entitled<br>
<b>"Profiles",<br>
"Posts",<br>
"Likes",<br>
"Comments",<br>
"Category",<br>
"Followers",<br>
"Admin",<br>
"Contact",<br>
"Community Chat",<br>
"Authentication",<br>
"Routing",<br>
"Notifications"</b> and<br>
<b>"Navigation"</b> providing the developer with the freedom to accomplish all issues/tasks flexibly before dates deadline set to June. The Milestones were broken according to their components name main functions.

Throughout the development process, new milestones were added, where tasks started from "Todo," progressing to "In Progress," and finally "Done". The issues were assigned to the sole developer and labeled as "could-have," "should-have,", "must-have", "wont-have" and later on labels like "has been implemented" and "future implementation" was also added.

### Design Choices

Our design philosophy at "Caption of the Day" is deeply rooted in providing a serene and approachable environment for our users to share and explore. The design choices are reflective of our commitment to a clean, modern, and user-centric interface.

#### Colors

The color scheme is a soothing mix of soft teal and cloud white, invoking a sense of calm and openness reminiscent of a clear sky. Teal, a color often associated with clarity of thought and communication, aligns perfectly with our platform's goal of fostering clear and open exchanges between users. The neutral grey accents used for text and icons provide a gentle contrast, ensuring readability and focus on user content without overwhelming the senses.

#### Typography

The font used is Barlow, a friendly and approachable sans-serif font, to make everything on the platform clear, easy to read, and inviting.<br>

Here's why Barlow is perfect for SourdoughCircle:<br>

- <b>Clear and Crisp:</b> Barlow's clean lines and open letterforms ensure all the sourdough goodness – from your post captions to comments – is easy to see, no matter what device you're using.<br>
- <b>Warm and Welcoming:</b> The slightly rounded edges of the Barlow typeface give it a touch of friendliness, reflecting the warm and inviting atmosphere of the SourdoughCircle community.<br>
- <b>Modern and Versatile:</b> Barlow's modern style keeps SourdoughCircle feeling fresh and up-to-date, while its versatility allows it to adapt to all kinds of content.

#### Imagery

SourdoughCircle keeps it simple and to the point with its app iconography.

- <b>Sourdough Icon:</b> The app utilizes a single, clean line drawing of a loaf of sourdough bread as both the favicon and the main icon in the navbar. This minimalist design makes the icon easily recognizable and ensures it scales well across different devices and screen sizes.<br>
- <b>Focus on Sourdough:</b> By featuring the bread itself, the icon immediately communicates the app’s purpose – a platform dedicated to sourdough bread.

- The rest of the icons and imagery follows along matching the colors and styles of the main navbar logo with clean lines, playful colors and easy for the eyes.

#### Initial Setup

1. **Create a Heroku Account**: Sign up for a Heroku account at [Heroku's website](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. **Install Heroku CLI**: Download and install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with Heroku from your local machine.

#### Preparing the Application

1. **Procfile**: Create a `Procfile` in your project root directory. This file tells Heroku how to run your application.
2. **Requirements.txt**: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies.
3. **Config Vars**: Set up necessary configuration variables in Heroku (like `SECRET_KEY`, database URL, etc.).

#### Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku App**: Use the Heroku CLI to create a new app.
2. **Add Buildpacks**: If necessary, add the correct buildpacks via the Heroku dashboard or CLI.
3. **Deploy**: Push your code to Heroku either by connecting your GitHub repository to Heroku or using the Heroku CLI to deploy your application.
4. **Database Migration (if applicable)**: Run database migrations using the Heroku CLI.

#### Final Steps

1. **Enable the Web Dyno**: Make sure the web dyno is up and running after deployment.
2. **Open the App**: You can open your application from the Heroku dashboard or using the CLI command `heroku open`.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub repository allows you to make a copy of the original project on your own GitHub account, enabling you to make changes without affecting the original. Here's how to do it:

1. **Go to the Repository**: Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the 'Fork' button, located at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
3. **Clone Your Fork**: Once forked, you can clone your fork to your local machine for further development.

### Making a Local Clone

Cloning a GitHub repository creates a local copy on your machine, allowing you to sync between the two locations. Here are the steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: On the GitHub repository page, click the 'Code' button and copy the URL under 'Clone with HTTPS'.
2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the clone to be created.
3. **Clone Command**: Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 1. Press Enter to create your local clone.

### Content

<!--This project has benefited from several educational resources and example projects provided by the Code Institute throughout the course of my bootcamp. The following projects deserve special mention for their direct impact on the development of this application:

- **Django REST Framework Example Project**: A practical example provided by the Code Institute that guided the development of Web APIs using Django REST framework. This project served as a template for best practices in API development with Django and Python.

- **Moments Project**: Another resource from the Code Institute, the Moments project was instrumental in illustrating the development of a full-stack application with a focus on user experience. Various aspects of its design and functionality have been adapted and incorporated into this project.

A heartfelt thank you goes to the Code Institute for the array of projects and resources that have been made available throughout my bootcamp. These resources have not only guided this project but have also been a cornerstone of my learning journey, providing me with a solid foundation in software development and a deep understanding of full-stack development practices.-->
